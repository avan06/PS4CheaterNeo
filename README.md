## Building

- Open `PS4CheaterNeo.sln` with Visual Studio([Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) also available) and built with .Net Framework 4.8.


## Description

- User interface re-layout and design to `dark mode`.
- The `cheat` window and the `query` window are separated.
- `Hex Editor` can be opened from the `cheat` or `query` window.
- `Pointer finder` can be executed from the `cheat` or `query` lists.

### SendPayload

- Opening the `PS4CheaterNeo` program will automatically detect whether `ps4debug` is enabled.
- If not enabled, `SendPayload` will be executed to enable `ps4debug`.
- You must specify the ps4 connection `IP` in SendPayload.
- `SendPayload` requires the `ps4debug.bin` file that conforms to the `FW` version.
- Port is `9090` when using `GoldHEN2.0b` to `Enable BinLoader Server`, Other `Bin Loader` tool port is usually `9021`.

> path\PS4CheaterNeo\bin\Debug\payloads\\[FW version]\ps4debug.bin  
> path\PS4CheaterNeo\bin\Release\payloads\\[FW version]\ps4debug.bin  

- It can be downloaded at the following URL(`Only ps4debug 6.72 has been tested`).

- You can add the address to the `Cheat List` from the `Query window` or `Hex Editor`, and can also be added manually.

### Query window

- Opening the query window will automatically refresh processes list, if eboot.bin already exists it will be selected.
- Support query multiple targets, Multiple query windows can be opened at the same time.
- In addition to query types such as `Byte, Float, Double, Hex`, etc., it also supports `Group` types.
- Make the `section` of the suspected target more obvious.
- The query value will skip the filtered `section` list when the filter checkbox is clicked.
- The preset `section` filter rules is `libSce, libc.prx, SceShell, SceLib, SceNp, SceVoice, SceFios, libkernel, SceVdec`, these rules can also be customized.

### Section

- The memory address of the PS4 game is the start position of the specific `section` plus the relative offset value.
- The start position of `sections` is `dynamic` and will change every time you start the game or load the game save or just go through a scene in the game.
- This program will reload the `sections` when executes the `lock` or `refresh` the cheat codes to ensure that it is correct.


### Group ScanType

- Use `group search` when you already know the `data structure` of the query target.
- Input format: [`ValueType`1:]`ValueNumber`1 [,] [`ValueType`2:]`ValueNumber`2 [,] [`ValueType`3:]`ValueNumber`3...
- The `ValueType` can be `1`(Byte), `2`(2 Bytes), `4`(4 Bytes), `8`(8 Bytes), `F`(Float), `D`(Double), `H`(Hex) or not specified.
- The `ValueType` is preset to 4 bytes when the value type is not specified.
- The `ValueNumber` can be specified as an asterisk(`*`) or question mark(`?`) when the value is unknown.
- The delimiter can be comma(`,`) or space(` `).

> Example:  
> Assuming the target `structure` is `63 00` `E7 03 00 00` `AB CD 00 00` `00 01`  
> `Group scan` can be entered as `2:99 999 ? 2:256`  


### Hex Editor

- Display the detailed information values of the address value of the current cursor position.
- Make address values greater than zero more obvious.
- You can add the address to the `Cheat List` from the current cursor position.

### Pointer finder

- Make the `base address` of the pointer be in the `executable section` when `FastScan` is clicked.
- If there is no result, you can try to click `NegativeOffset`.
- The finder will skip the filtered section list when the `filter` checkbox is clicked.
- The preset section filter rules is `libSce, libc.prx, SceShell, SceLib, SceNp, SceVoice, SceFios, libkernel, SceVdec`, these rules can also be customized.
